    <h1>About Naomi</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Naomi.</p>
    <p>I am 28 years old, and I am a Leo.</p>
    <p>I don't know quite what to say, especially when introducing myself. I always get so awkward when I do, so I'll try my best.</p>
    <p>I was born in Colorado, but moved to New Mexico when I was a few months, and have been here all my life.</p>
    <p>I do plan to leave New Mexico, sometime in the near future. I would like to move east somewhere.</p>
    <p>I am a CODA, which means Child Of Deaf Adults. I am fluent in ASL (American Sign Language).</p>
    <p>I am the oldest of 4 girls, but I look like the youngest, and am the smallest haha.</p>
    <p>I love to watch movies, listening to music, reading, anime, and also reading manga.</p>
    <p>If you had to ask my what my favorite movies were I wouldn't be able to pinpoint it to just one, so I give my top five.</p>
    <p>And those are:</p>
        <li>Pretty In Pink</li>
        <li>Nightmare Before Christmas</li>
        <li>Lord Of The Rings</li>
        <li>Queen Of The Damned</li>
        <li>Pride and Prejudice (2005)</li>
    <p>My favorite band is Blink-182 (before they broke up), and my favorite song is "How Soon Is Now?" by The Smiths.</p>
    <p>My favorite anime to watch is Ouran High School Host Club. I swear I can watch it all day, every day, and it never gets old.</p>
    <p>And my favorite manga to read is anything in the "BL/Yaoi" and comedy-romance genre.</p>
    <p>My favorite color is red, my favorite animal is a Lion, and my favorite food is Asian food.</p>
    <p>If you would like to get to know me a little better I like the whole Freud method to learn about people, so down below is my 3 Q&A's.</p>
    <p>My favorite animal is a Lion. I like them because they're beautiful, majestic, and cunning.</p>
    <p>My favorite article of clothing is a pair of jeans. I like them because they're comfortable, complimentary, and secure.</p>
    <p>My favorite body of water is an ocean. I like the ocean because its calming, terrifying, but ethereal.</p>
