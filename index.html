    <p><br/></p>
    <p>Hello, my name is Naomi.</p>
    <p>I am 28 years old, and I am a Leo.</p>
    <p>Let's me tell you about my amazing self.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <h2>My Life</h2>

    <p>I was born in Colorado, but moved to New Mexico when I was a few months, and have been here all my life.</p>
    <p>When I was a few months old, I was able to do 100 sit-ups, 100 push-ups, 100 squats, and 10 kilometer run in one day.</p>
    <p>I do plan to leave New Mexico, sometime in the near future. I would like to move east somewhere.</p>
    <p>I am a CODA, which means Child Of Deaf Adults. I am fluent in ASL (American Sign Language),
        and 10 difference languages, as well as mind reading.</p>
    <p>I am the oldest of 4 girls, but I look like the youngest. I am the smallest out the four and also the smartest.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <h2>My Passion</h2>
    <p>I love to watch movies, listening to music, reading, watching anime, and also reading manga</p>
    <p>on top of the Mount Everest during my spare time.</p>
    <p>If you had to ask my what my favorite movies were I wouldn't be able to pinpoint it to just one, so I give my <strong>TOP TEN.</strong></p>
    <p>And those are:</p>
        <li>Pretty In Pink</li>
        <li>Nightmare Before Christmas</li>
        <li>Lord Of The Rings</li>
        <li>Queen Of The Damned</li>
        <li>Pride and Prejudice (2005)</li>

    <h2>More Stuff That I LOVE</h2>
    <p>My favorite band is Blink-182 (before they broke up), and my favorite song is "<i>How Soon Is Now?</i>" by The Smiths.</p>
    <p>My favorite anime to watch is <i>Ouran High School Host Club</i>. I swear I can watch it all day, every day, and it never gets old.</p>
    <p>And my favorite manga to read is anything in the "BL/Yaoi" and comedy-romance genre.</p>
    <p>My favorite color is red, my favorite animal is a Lion, and my favorite food is Asian food.</p>
    <p>My favorite thing to do at a friend’s house is using their bathroom, and peeking at their medicine cabinet for a whole minute and a half. </p>
    <p>If you would like to get to know me a little better I like the whole Freud method to learn about people, so down below are Q&A's about me.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <h2>Q&A's</h2>
    <p><b>My favorite animal is a Lion.</b></p>
        <li>I like them because they're beautiful, majestic, cunning, and it's a BIG CAT!!</li>
    <p><b>My favorite article of clothing is a pair of jeans.</b></p>
        <li>I like them because they're comfortable, complimentary, and secure.</li>
    <p><b>My favorite body of water is an ocean.</b></p>
        <li>I like the ocean because its calming, terrifying, but ethereal.</li>

    <p><br/></p>
